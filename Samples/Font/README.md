This folder contains code points for icons in the MaterialUI icon set.

A searchable display of the icons/codepoints is here: https://material.io/icons

The full set of codepoint=>unicode-hex mappings can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/arcadefx/material-ui/blob/master/icon-font/codepoints

If you want to rebuild the code points asset, edit or redownload the file MaterialUI-Icon-CodePoints.txt and then click the 'Rebuild From Code Points File' button in the Inspector for the MaterialUI-Icon-CodePoints asset (both files should be in same directory as this README)
